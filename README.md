# Diwali Sales Exploratory-Data-Analysis

**1. Project Background**

I worked on a data analysis project using a **Diwali sales dataset**, which captured customer purchase behavior across different states during the festive season in India. The goal was to clean the data, perform **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**, and pull out useful business insights to understand **who buys what**, **from where**, and **why** — basically, helping businesses plan better for festive seasons.

**2. Executive Summary**

- **Goal**: To analyze consumer purchase behavior and identify key drivers of sales during the Diwali season and visualized patterns using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- **Outcome**: Key customer segments, high-performing states and product categories, and purchase behavior by demographic factors were identified to assist in data-driven decision-making.

**3. Insights Deep-Dive**

- **Gender**: Female customers not only dominate purchase counts but also contribute higher sales revenue.
- **Age Group**: The 26–35 age segment emerged as the most active in both order volume and revenue.
- **Marital Status**: Married women exhibited the highest purchasing power.
- **State**: Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka led in both orders and total sales.
- **Occupation**: Professionals in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation showed higher spending.
- **Product Category**: Food, Clothing, and Electronics were the most purchased categories.

**4. Sales Trends and Growth Rates**

- Though this dataset is cross-sectional, we see peak sales from key states and age brackets, suggesting potential for year-over-year growth if similar campaigns are run.
- Orders per customer averaged **2.5**, indicating room for increasing order frequency through loyalty programs.

**5. Key Product Performance**

- Top 10 most sold products were visualized by `Product_ID`, with repeated purchases hinting at product popularity and satisfaction.
- Food and clothing had the highest transaction volumes and revenues, indicating these should be core focus categories during future sales events.

**6. Customer Growth and Repeat Purchase Trends**

- While individual-level repeat behavior analysis is limited without timestamps, the high average order count (2–3 per user) implies some customer stickiness.
- Targeting high-frequency buyers from the 26–35 married female segment can increase CLTV (Customer Lifetime Value).
    
**7. Recommendations**

- **Customer Segmentation**: Focus marketing on married women aged 26–35 in top-performing states.
- **Product Strategy**: Prioritize inventory for Food, Clothing, and Electronics during Diwali sales.
- **Occupation-Based Offers**: Special discounts for professionals in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation.
- **Loyalty Program**: Launch personalized offers and cashback incentives to promote repeat buying.
- **Data Enhancement**: Track channels, timestamps, and returns for deeper future insights.
